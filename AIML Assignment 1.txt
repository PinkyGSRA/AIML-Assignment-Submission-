Expalin Machine Learning With your own Example?
   
   Machine learning is an art and science of programming computers so they can learn from 
Data.Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
       
            Traffic Predictions: We all have been using GPS navigation services. While we do 
that, our current locations and velocities are being saved at a central server for managing 
traffic. This data is then used to build a map of current traffic. While this helps in 
preventing the traffic and does congestion analysis, the underlying problem is that there are 
less number of cars that are equipped with GPS. Machine learning in such scenarios helps to 
estimate the regions where congestion can be found on the basis of daily experiences.
